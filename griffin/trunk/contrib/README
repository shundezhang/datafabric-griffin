Some configuration files that make working easier.

== Eclipse ==
 * griffin-code-formatters.xml:
   Open the project properties, select "Java Code Style -> Formatter",
   and enable "project specific settings."  Then you import this file,
   and select the (newly imported) "Griffin Conventions".
 
 * griffin-code-templates.xml:
   Open the project properties, select "Java Code Style -> Code Templates",
   and enable "project specific settings."  Then you import this file.
   You may want to customise the occurrences of "Your Name", "Your Institution",
   ... along with URLs and e-mail addresses.
   
 * griffin-code-checks.xml:
   (Requires "Eclipse Checkstyle plugin".)
   Open the project properties, select "Checkstyle" and enable "Checkstyle
   active for this project".  Select the second tab ("Local Check
   Configuration") and add a new configuration.  In the dialogue, select the
   "Project Relative Configuration" type, choose this file, and call the new 
   configuration e. g. "Griffin Checks".  Back on the "Main" tab, select the 
   new "Griffin Checks" to activate the checks for the plugin.

 * acceptance_testing (directory):
   This directory contains some Python scripts to test standard operations
   against a GridFTP server.  The script uses Python the doctest, with the
   tests specified in text files within the "tests" sub-directory.  Execution
   of the "acceptance_testing.py" script from within the acceptance_testing
   directory should execute the whole test suite.  Certain configuration
   for the tests can be tweaked simply by editing "test_config.py" (e. g.
   name of host to test).
